				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>“MENA Value”</strong> Portfolio is an absolute return strategy that aims to achieve long-term (three to five years) capital appreciation by investing in listed equities and fixed income securities in the Middle East/North Africa region (MENA) and Turkey.  The investment team seeks to hold a highly diversified portfolio with the intent to manage unsystematic risk, turnover, and volatility over a long-term time horizon. Investments are selected based on a bottom-up approach by screening for high return on invested capital, strong balance sheet, high and sustainable dividend yield, strong business model and attractive valuations. The MENA Value portfolio has a low turnover and a higher sharpe ratio when compared to the S&amp;P Pan Arabia Index.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>“MENA Tactical”</strong> Portfolio is a highly concentrated, absolute return strategy focused on the MENA region, with a very strong tilt to GCC countries. The investment team conducts rigorous cross country and cross sector research to identify and benefit from market inefficiencies in the short to medium term (three months to three years). This concentrated portfolio builds large positions based on high earnings growth potential, turnaround stories, and momentum driven investment opportunities. Turnover rate is high and the portfolio structure differs greatly from the S&amp;P Pan Arabia Index.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>“Global Long Short ”</strong> Portfolio is one of very few Global Long Short Macro funds locally based and managed in the city of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Al Dhabi Global Long Short Macro is a generalist, long short equity tilted fund that uses a top down sector based thematic approach with a bottom up fundamental stock selection approach in global equity markets. The fund’s objective is to achieve consistent, positive absolute returns throughout any market cycle. We use a top down sector selection strategy wherein we identify which sectors will outperform/underperform the market, followed by a bottom up stock selection within each sector. We go long the sectors we are bullish on and short the sectors we are bearish on. The time horizon for our investments is between 6 to 12 months. The portfolio also makes select use of equity derivatives and foreign exchange forward contracts for hedging/investment gains.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>“UAE Select”</strong> Portfolio invests in equities of the United Arab Emirates listed in the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange, the Dubai Financial Market, Nasdaq Dubai, London Stock Exchange and any other exchange listed/unquoted equity securities of the UAE. This portfolio has an eclectic investment style of “core value” and “peripheral growth”. Core ideas have a value tilt and are selected based on high and sustainable dividend yield, strong balance sheets, high ROEs, and high return on invested capital. The core Value strategy has a long term investment horizon of three to five years. The peripheral growth strategy has a short to medium term investment horizon (three months to three years) and is invested opportunistically depending on market inefficiencies. The peripheral growth strategy focuses on names that are momentum driven, with short to medium term capital appreciation catalysts, and high earnings growth.  The relative composition of Value and Growth strategies within the portfolio varies and depends on our view of the market cycle in the UAE.</p>
